## ⚙️ What It Does
The **GitHub Actions workflow (ci.yml)** automatically runs every time you push code to this repository.  
It performs the following:
- Checks out the repository code  
- Sets up Node.js  
- Installs dependencies (if applicable)  
- Runs tests or a build process (placeholder for now)

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Push any changes to the repository.  
2. Go to the **Actions** tab in GitHub.  
3. Watch the workflow run automatically.  

## 📁 app/index.html
The `index.html` file is just a placeholder for a simple static app — you can use it to simulate your frontend or website code.  
It’s not used by the workflow yet but gives structure for a real project.
